'''Rotate Matrix/ Image - LeetCode 48
You are given an n x n 2D matrix representing an image, rotate the image by 90 degrees (clockwise).

You have to rotate the image in-place, which means you have to modify the input 2D matrix directly.

DO NOT allocate another 2D matrix and do the rotation.'''



def rotate(matrix):
    n = len(matrix)
    
    # Step 1: Transpose the matrix
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(i, n):
            matrix[i][j], matrix[j][i] = matrix[j][i], matrix[i][j]
    
    # Step 2: Reverse each row
    for i in range(n):
        matrix[i].reverse()

# Example usage:
matrix = [
    [1, 2, 3],
    [4, 5, 6],
    [7, 8, 9]
]

rotate(matrix)
print(matrix)  # Output should be [[7, 4, 1], [8, 5, 2], [9, 6, 3]]
